# Breast Cancer Recurrence Prediction

This project applies machine learning techniques to predict breast cancer recurrence using both unsupervised and supervised learning methods. The workflow includes data cleaning, feature engineering, clustering analysis, classification modeling, forecasting unknown outcomes, and model performance comparison.

## 🔍 Project Highlights
- Preprocessing of `.arff` dataset into usable numeric format
- KMeans clustering to reveal hidden patterns
- Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers for recurrence prediction
- Simulated forecasting of unknown outcomes
- Evaluation using Accuracy, ROC AUC, and RMSE

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the **Breast Cancer** dataset in `.arff` format, available at:
[https://github.com/renatopp/arff-datasets/blob/master/classification/breast.cancer.arff](https://github.com/renatopp/arff-datasets/blob/master/classification/breast.cancer.arff)

> This dataset contains anonymized patient attributes including age, tumor size, and treatment indicators, with a target label indicating recurrence status.

## 📊 Notebooks Included
- `cleandata.ipynb` – Data import, cleaning, and preparation  
- `feature_engineering.ipynb` – Feature transformation and encoding  
- `clustering_and_classification.ipynb` – Clustering, classification, and evaluation  

## 📄 Outputs
- 📄 Final Report: Summary of methods, results, and visuals  
- 📊 Presentation Slides: Slide deck presenting workflow and findings

## 📌 Project Goal
To explore how machine learning can be used to support breast cancer prognosis by analyzing patterns in clinical data.
